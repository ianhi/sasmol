'''
	View is the main module that contains the base classes that 
	read and write atomic information from and to external viewers
	such as vmd and others in the future (PyMol, etc.).
	
	To view the coordinates the viewer needs to be open and controlled
	external to view / sasmol.  These methods merely allow 
	coordinates to be passed between programs.

	See the following sites for the IMD format:

	http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/
	http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/

	These classes are accessed by the SasAtm class found in
	the sasmol module.
